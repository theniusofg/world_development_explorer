Analytical and communications skills are required.\n## You ARE a\n- Data analyst\n- Business analyst\n- Social science researcher \n## You are NOT a \n- Data scientist\n- Python programmer \n- Software engineer\n## Step 1. Visit the World Bank website for information about the World Development Indicators \n- https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/\n## Step 2. Play with the World Development Explorer (WDX) and get familar with its functionalities\n- The WDX main page (the explorer) \n    - http://www.worlddev.xyz\n- Use this page to understand the definition of each topic and its indicators\n    - http://www.worlddev.xyz/indicators\n- Use this page to get familiar with regions and countries \n    - http://www.worlddev.xyz/countries    - \n## Step 3. Think about your interests \n- Determine What Topics are interesting to you? \n    - There are 22 topics inclding Health, Environment, Education, Energy, etc.\n    - For each topic of your interest, explore the vast indicators \n- Determine what indicators are interesting to you\n- Determine what countries are interesting to you\n    - You must select at least two countries for comparison\n- Determine what time span you would like to cover\n    -  The data span from 1960 to 2018\n    -  Your time span must be at least 5 years\n    -  Suggestion: **2010 to 2018**\n## Step 4. Use WDX to explore the topics and indicators of your interests\n- Try to utilize all charts provided by WDX\n- Download the charts that are insightful \n- Taking note of your understanding of the charts\n    - what does it reveal to you?\n## Step 5. Write a report using Markdown format to document your effort\n- Think of yourself writing a blog that will be published on the web. \n    - For example, http://www.medium.com\n- You must use Markdown format not Jupyter Notebook format\n- You must use at least three different charts (for example, 2D scatter, Bar, and Line chart)\n- You should provide a detailed introduction about the project, for example,\n    - What is it that you are investigating/exploring/analyzing (provide sufficient background information)?\n    - Why is it important to you and/or to others?\n    - What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?\n    - Where do you get the data to help answer your questions?  \n    - What process/step you use to analyze the situation/issue\n- You will report the findings and your analysis of each issue/question after the introduction\n- Use the downloaded charts and provide interpretations/explanations/analysis\n- You compare different countries and show similarities/differences and their implcations \n    - Use Bar charts\n- You also look at the historic trend to spot any changes\n    - Use Line charts\n- You will also explore relations between different topics/indicators \n    - For example, wealth may impact health, women's education levels may impact their employment.\n    - Use scatter plots (2D scatter and/or bubble chart)\n## Step 6. Create a separate GitHub repository for this project\n- Name the project \"world_development_explorer\"\n- Create a folder call \"charts\" and upload the charts there\n- Create a Markdown file called \"wdx_analysis.md\" for your report\n- Submit the link to this repository to Black Board\n",
